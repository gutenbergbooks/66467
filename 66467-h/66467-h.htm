LETTER,<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Beloved Brethren</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> seven years and three months I
laboured among you.&nbsp; Thousands of you knew me in the
Confessional; almost all of you have heard my voice from the
pulpit; I have baptized not a few among you.&nbsp; I have
laboured in the four most populous centres in your
diocese&mdash;Sligo, Strokestown, Roscommon, and
Athlone&mdash;and from the day on which I entered upon my work to
the day of my departure from the diocese, there has never been a
word of disagreement between us.&nbsp; I resided but four months
in the parish of Strokestown, yet, at my departure, my flock
presented me with a purse of sovereigns.&nbsp; Most of you have
read the comments in the local journals when I left the diocese,
and I leave them to speak for themselves.</p>
<p>I am returning to live and die among you if you will permit
me, and I know the question that will naturally be asked by every
one of you.&nbsp; You will say&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, we remember
Father Connellan very well.&nbsp; He preached in our chapel, and
we used to call him &lsquo;the fair-haired priest.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But wasn&rsquo;t he drowned in Lough Ree a couple of years
ago?&nbsp; Is it his ghost that is coming among us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, my clear friends, I am thankful to say I was not drowned
in Lough Ree.&nbsp; I left the diocese, put off my clerical garb,
and worked on the Press in London for eighteen months.&nbsp; It
was rather a curious thing for a &ldquo;fair-haired priest&rdquo;
to do, arid I am going to give you my reasons for the step in as
few words as possible.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>I was not
more than two years a priest when I began to have conscientious
scruples.&nbsp; I shall tell you the causes of these scruples and
troubles, not in the order in which they arose, for that would be
impossible in a short sketch like the present, and if you cannot
master the difficulties yourselves, you can ask your parish
priest to explain them for you.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; We have all a great love for St. Patrick, and I used
to read everything I could lay my hands on concerning him when I
was a Roman Catholic priest.&nbsp; Now, St. Patrick left some
writings in manuscript, and one of these is called &ldquo;St.
Patrick&rsquo;s Confession.&rdquo;&nbsp; All agree in believing
this the genuine work of St. Patrick.&nbsp; Now, the following
are the opening words of St. Patrick&rsquo;s
Confession:&mdash;&ldquo;I, Patrick, a sinner, the rudest and the
least of all the faithful, and most contemptible to very many,
had for my father Calpurnius, a deacon, a son of Potitus a
presbyter, who dwelt in the village of Bannavem
Taberniae.&rdquo;&nbsp; Presbyter, I may tell you, is the old
word for priest, so we find that St. Patrick&rsquo;s father was a
deacon, and his grandfather a priest.&nbsp; If a Roman Catholic
deacon or priest were to marry now, he would at once be
suspended; and don&rsquo;t you think the priests and deacons
living only three centuries after Christ were more likely to be
right than those of the nineteenth century?</p>
<p>Again, in none of the works of St. Patrick is there a single
word about devotion to the Blessed Virgin, the Sacrifice of the
Mass, Purgatory, Invocation of Saints, or the like.&nbsp; St.
Patrick always prays to God alone, and Joceline, an early Roman
Catholic historian, says of him&mdash;&ldquo;He used to read the
Bible to the people, and explain it to them for days and nights
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lastly, you have always believed, and so did I for nearly
thirty years, that St. Patrick planted the Roman Catholic
religion in Ireland in the fifth century.&nbsp; We know that
every part of the Island became Christian, and that Ireland was
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>called
&ldquo;the Island of Saints.&rdquo;&nbsp; But if St. Patrick
planted the Roman Catholic religion in Ireland in the fifth
century, is it not very curious that in the Bull given by Adrian
IV. to Henry the Second, in which he permits Henry to conquer
Ireland, the Pope expressly states he does it &ldquo;in order to
widen the bounds of the Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Pope handed over
Ireland to Henry the Second on condition &ldquo;that he would
take care that a penny should be annually paid from every house
in Ireland to St. Peter,&rdquo; and his Holiness expressly states
that his object is &ldquo;to widen the bounds of the
Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, Christianity had been spread into every
corner of &ldquo;the Island of Saints&rdquo; for seven centuries,
and yet the Pope wants to &ldquo;widen the boundaries of the
Church&rdquo; by introducing <i>his</i> religion into
Ireland.&nbsp; What does it mean?&nbsp; Well, I give you the
facts from Dr. Lanigan, a Roman Catholic historian (vol. iv.,
164), and leave you to draw your own conclusion.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; When I was a Roman Catholic priest, one of my chief
duties was to hear confessions.&nbsp; It is not a pleasant duty,
I can assure you, but it was always a pleasure to me to work for
the good-natured Irish peasantry.&nbsp; Well, the chief argument
in support of Confession is taken from the 20th chapter of St.
John&rsquo;s Gospel and the 23rd verse&mdash;&ldquo;Whose sins
you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you
shall retain, they are retained.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, to understand
the point of my argument, you must read in your Douay Testament
from verse 19.&nbsp; Then turn back to the 24th chapter of St.
Luke, and commence at the 33rd verse.&nbsp; Both Evangelists
narrate exactly the same incident; for in both he said,
&ldquo;Peace be to you,&rdquo; and &ldquo;He showed them His
hands and His side.&rdquo;&nbsp; But what do we find?&nbsp; In
St. John, verse 19, we find that it was the
&ldquo;Disciples,&rdquo; not the eleven Apostles only, who
&ldquo;were gathered together for fear of the Jews.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In St. Luke, verse 33, we find that it was &ldquo;the
eleven&rdquo; &ldquo;and those that were with them&rdquo; whom
Jesus <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>addressed.&nbsp; Thence it follows that not alone did
Jesus give to the eleven Apostles the power of forgiving sins,
but He gave it to &ldquo;those who were with them&rdquo;&mdash;to
the whole company of the &ldquo;Disciples,&rdquo; and among that
company there were certainly some women.&nbsp; Therefore Christ
gave power to women to remit sins in the Confessional.&nbsp; It
follows as a necessary consequence; and I hope you will ask one
of your priests to solve the difficulty for you.&nbsp; My
friends, you will find nowhere in the New Testament a record of
any of the Apostles having remitted sins in the
Confessional.&nbsp; They remitted them, no doubt, by preaching
the Gospel of Christ.&nbsp; They bound and loosed, as you may see
(Acts xv. 28, 29); but there is no record of their having set up
the Confessional.&nbsp; In the 16th chapter of the Acts, when the
terrified keeper of the prison fell down at the feet of Paul and
Silas, saying, &ldquo;Masters, what must I do that I may be
saved?&rdquo; we do not read that Paul took out his stole, and
asked him to make his confession.&nbsp; On the contrary, he said,
&ldquo;Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be
saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, it can be conclusively proved from
history that private confession was introduced by Leo I. in the
fifth century.&nbsp; Public confession always existed.&nbsp; St.
James inculcates it (chap. v. 16), where he says, &ldquo;Confess
therefore your sins one to another,&rdquo; showing that the
priest is just as much bound to confess his sins to you as you
are to the priest.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; All Roman Catholics try, where they can, to go to
Mass every Sunday and holiday, and they believe that Jesus Christ
is really and substantially present in the Host.&nbsp; They
believe they receive Him in the Holy Communion also: and many of
you are yet living, I have no doubt, to whom I carried the Holy
Communion when you were sick.&nbsp; Now, the carnal presence of
Christ in the Eucharist is tried to be proved from the sixth
chapter of St. John and from the words of institution.&nbsp; The
words in the sixth chapter of St. John must have <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>been spoken at
least thirteen months before the Last Supper, as may be seen by a
reference to John vi. 4 and John xii. 1.&nbsp; The Church of Rome
says Christ&rsquo;s words, both in the Sixth of John, and at the
Last Supper, must be taken literally.&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp; In
the 54th verse of the sixth chapter of St. John, Christ says,
&ldquo;Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his
blood, you shall not have life in you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore all
who do not receive the Holy Communion must perish, and baptized
infants, for example, are eternally damned, I say the conclusion
is inevitable, if the doctrine of the Church of Rome be
true.&nbsp; But the same Church of Rome holds that baptized
infants, when they die go straight to God.&nbsp; Again, in the
55th verse, Christ says, &ldquo;He that eateth My flesh, and
drinketh My blood, hath everlasting life: and I will raise him up
in the last day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore all communicants are
saved.&nbsp; In fact, you are landed in absurdities to no end
unless you take Christ&rsquo;s own interpretation in the 64th
verse, &ldquo;The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jesus gives the key also in the 35th verse,
where He said, &ldquo;He that cometh to me shall not hunger; and
he that believeth in me, shall never thirst.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
by believing in Jesus, and coming to Him, that we are to have
eternal life.&nbsp; But the Roman Catholic Church attempts to
prove the carnal presence of Christ in the Eucharist from the
words of institution also: &ldquo;This is My body, this is My
blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; She says nothing can be clearer than these
words, and that, unless Christ intended to leave His real Body
and Blood, He would have been guilty of deception.&nbsp; Well,
when Jacob, in Genesis xlix. 9, said, &ldquo;Juda is a
lion&rsquo;s whelp,&rdquo; his words were very plain; but do you
think any of his hearers believed Juda to be really a
lion&rsquo;s whelp?&nbsp; When we read in the 118th Psalm (verse
105), &ldquo;Thy word is a lamp to my feet,&rdquo; do we think
God&rsquo;s Word really a material lamp?&nbsp; When we read in
John (x. 9), &ldquo;I am the door,&rdquo; do we believe Christ to
be really a <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>door?&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; Holy Scripture is full of
figurative language, and Christ constantly used it.&nbsp;
Besides, in Luke (xxii. 19) we read, &ldquo;Do this for a
commemoration of me,&rdquo; and in 1 Cor. xi. 26 we read,
&ldquo;For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the
chalice, you shall show the death of the Lord, until He
come.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the Lord&rsquo;s Supper was to be a
memorial, a commemoration of Christ.&nbsp; But we do not keep a
memento of a person, no matter how dear, who is bodily
present.&nbsp; It is only when the friend is really departing
that he leaves a memorial.&nbsp; Jesus, in John (xiv. 2, 3),
says, &ldquo;I go to prepare a place for you.&nbsp; I will come
again, and will take you to myself, that where I am, you also may
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why did not Christ say, &ldquo;Do not be
troubled.&nbsp; I am leaving myself in the Eucharist.&nbsp; You
can handle me, feed on me.&nbsp; I shall be a thousand times more
intimately connected with you than ever before.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
says nothing of the kind, however.&nbsp; Nor does St. Peter in
his famous sermon (Acts iii. 20) at Solomon&rsquo;s porch; but he
says, &ldquo;When the times of refreshment shall come, He shall
send Jesus Christ, whom heaven indeed must receive until the
times of the restitution of all things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I should be sorry to weary you, and so the last point
I shall discuss here is the alleged primacy of jurisdiction given
by Christ to St. Peter, and through him to the Pope.&nbsp; The
chief text upon which the Roman Catholic Church relies in this
matter is Matt. xvi. 18&mdash;&ldquo;And I say to thee, That thou
art Peter and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the
gates of hell shall not prevail against it.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a
note in the Douay Testament we are told that Christ&rsquo;s words
were the same as if He said in English, &ldquo;Thou art a rock,
and upon this rock I will build my Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it is
very remarkable that the Evangelist uses the word Petros for
Peter, and Petra for the rock.&nbsp; Now Petros means a stone,
while Petra means a rock; so that the words of Christ would
really signify &ldquo;thou art a <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>stone, and upon this rock I will build
my Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; If Christ intended to found His Church
upon Peter, He surely would have said, &ldquo;Thou art Peter, and
upon <i>thee</i> I will build my Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; But He
really does say, thou art Peter (that is a stone), and upon this
rock (Petra) I will build my Church.&nbsp; Peter certainly was a
stone in the edifice equally with the other Apostles, for St.
John in the Apocalypse (xxi. 14) tells us that the wall of the
new Jerusalem &ldquo;had twelve foundations, and in them the
names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.&rdquo;&nbsp; St.
Augustine distinctly states that Christ is the
rock&mdash;&ldquo;Because I am Petra, a rock, thou art Petrus,
Peter; for Petra, the rock, is not from Petrus, Peter; but
Petrus, Peter, is from Petra the rock.&nbsp; And upon this rock I
will build my Church; not upon Peter, whom thou art, but upon the
rock whom thou hast confessed&rdquo; (tom, v., 1097).&nbsp; St.
Jerome holds the same opinion.&nbsp; But the Church of Rome says
Christ gave Peter the keys (Matt. xvi. 19).&nbsp; No doubt; and
Peter admitted the Jews by the doors of the Church (Acts ii. 41),
and afterwards the Gentiles (Acts x.).&nbsp; He also gave him
power to bind and loose, and bestowed exactly the same power on
the other Apostles (Matt. xviii. 18).&nbsp; But even if Christ
had conferred upon Peter this extraordinary power, it would not
follow that it has been transmitted to the Pope.&nbsp; They tell
us that St. Peter was the first Bishop of Rome.&nbsp; But what
authority have we for such a statement?&nbsp; Only a shadowy
tradition.&nbsp; St. Peter is said to have founded the Church of
Antioch, and has written an Epistle from Babylon.&nbsp; Why
should not the bishops of Antioch or Babylon have as good a right
to call themselves successors to St. Peter as the bishops of
Rome?&nbsp; The Roman Catholic Church says Peter was bishop of
Rome for twenty-five years, and was put to death the same year
with St. Paul.&nbsp; Well, the Acts of the Apostles take us down
to <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 66, and it is most
extraordinary they never mention Peter in connection with the See
of Rome.&nbsp; <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Even more extraordinary, if possible, is the fact that,
although St. Paul resided two whole years at Rome, and wrote
several Epistles therefrom, he never once mentions Peter&rsquo;s
name.&nbsp; In his second Epistle to Timothy, written, as the
Douay Testament tells us, &ldquo;not long before his
martyrdom,&rdquo; he says: &ldquo;Only Luke is with
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nay, when he was before Nero, at his first
examination, not a friend stood by to comfort him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;At my first answer, no man stood with me, but all forsook
me; may it not be laid to their charge.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where was
Peter?&nbsp; The Church of Rome says he had been residing at Rome
twenty-five years then.&nbsp; Was St. Paul totally ignorant of
his presence there?</p>
<p>I do not propose to touch upon any more points of controversy
just now, but from what I have written, you will gather that it
would have been dishonourable and wicked of me to remain in the
Church of Rome.&nbsp; Of course the proper thing for me to do was
to write to my bishop, and resign into his hands the charge he
had given me seven years previously.&nbsp; But you know how a
poor Irish priest, who retires from his ministry for
conscientious motives, is reviled and persecuted.&nbsp; Then, my
parents were living.&nbsp; I dare say some of you know them, and
if you do, you are aware that they are devout Roman Catholics,
and are respected and esteemed by their acquaintances.&nbsp; They
doated upon me, and I knew they would much prefer to weep over my
dead body than mourn over what to them would be my fall.&nbsp; I
gave them the easier alternative.&nbsp; On Tuesday, the 20th of
September, 1887, I said Mass in St. Peter&rsquo;s, Athlone, as
usual; had a talk with my old parish priest, Dr. Coffey, about
schools, after breakfast, and then left, as I suppose for
ever.&nbsp; I sent a suit of secular clothes to my boat, pulled
up to Lough Ree, and, having left my lay suit on the bank,
undressed in the boat and swam ashore.&nbsp; I thank God that
from that moment I have had, what I had not tasted for years
previously, perfect <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>peace.&nbsp; I got a position as sub-editor on a London
newspaper, and for eighteen months gave myself to deep and
constant study in the British Museum.&nbsp; I began to feel that
it was God&rsquo;s will I should return to Ireland, and tell my
dearly-loved countrymen of all that Christ has done for me.&nbsp;
He has accepted me.&nbsp; I, a poor sinner, believe in the Lord
Jesus Christ, cast myself upon Him, and know that &ldquo;I have
peace with God, being justified by faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; God spared
not His own Son.&nbsp; &ldquo;He made Him to be sin for
us,&rdquo; therefore for me.&nbsp; &ldquo;We were reconciled to
God by the death of His Son.&rdquo;&nbsp; This blessed acceptance
has flooded my very soul with spiritual joy and gratitude, and as
the perennial fountain spreads its waters over the surrounding
meadows, so, my friends, do I long to impart to others the riches
with which Christ has endowed me.&nbsp; I have nothing to say,
except what Paul said to his own countrymen after his conversion:
&ldquo;But this I confess to thee, that according to the sect
which they call heresy, so I serve the Father and my God,
believing all things which are written in the law and the
prophets&rdquo; (Acts xxiv. 14).&nbsp; I have written nothing
that I have not grounded upon God&rsquo;s Word.&nbsp; Christ bids
us &ldquo;Search the Scriptures.&rdquo;&nbsp; I hope to meet you
all again, and to prove to you from God&rsquo;s book, admitted by
your own Church to be inspired, that I have followed God&rsquo;s
guidance.&nbsp; Your priest may denounce me, but I am quite
willing to discuss the matter with him, and accept you, his own
flock, as the judges.&nbsp; Meanwhile, may God bless you all, and
may you &ldquo;grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

cannot be read by your equipment.

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
